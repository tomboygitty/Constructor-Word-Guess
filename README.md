# Constructor-Word-Guess
Node.js based word guess (hangman) game

This is a word guessing game that runs in a Node.js environment. It is a basic hangman-type game in which the player guesses single letters until they win or lose. 10 incorrect guesses are allowed.

This game was made with constructors to track whether individual letters had already been guessed.

This game uses Inquirer as an NPM dependency.

This game was entirely made by Tom Elliott.
